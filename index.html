				<p>Hi, Alisha here, thanks for stopping by! I'm a total goof-ball who loves life and is so excited about continuing to learn to code. I completed three amazing months at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program, where I completed full stack projects and broke code constantly. From there, I decided I wanted to focus more on Front-End Development so I took some additional classes this summer. I loved it so much that I'm currently an Expert In Residence at General Assembly for their evening Front End Development classes, where I assist students with their projects and homework. When I'm not doing that, I love to watch documentaries, make jewelry, travel, paint, do yoga and my all-time favorite activity is cake decorating.</p>
				<p>This is a picture of me playing outdoor skeeball at one of the opening parties of the <a href="http://www.worlddominationsummit.com" target="_blank">World Domination Summit</a>, an incredible conference in Portland, OR that I've gone to for the past three years. It's the most inspiring weekend of the year and is a constant reminder for me to follow my dreams and passions. </p>
